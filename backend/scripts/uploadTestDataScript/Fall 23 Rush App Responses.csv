Ally,Tan,,She/Her/Hers,allytan@ucsb.edu,650-353-0689,Santa Catalina Hall Room 7432,,1st Year,2027,undeclared(pre-bio/pre-med route),"Growing up, I’ve always been highly involved in team efforts. Whether it was playing soccer for more than half my life, joining school clubs, or working in various restaurants and schools, I found that I have built numerous beneficial relationships and skills in these various communities. The friendships that I’ve built through soccer, work, and volunteering, have been immensely rewarding. When walking through campus on my second day of school, I came across a booth for Alpha Kappa Psi. A girl (also named Ally) approached me with a cheerful attitude to discuss this fraternity. Upon hearing about the networking, friendships, and business opportunities, I was immediately hooked. I’m currently an undeclared major, but I am actively pursuing the pre-medical route in hopes of become a plastic surgeon. Though science is my main focus, I am extremely interested in business entrepreneurship and marketing. (Assuming I eventually reach my goal of becoming a surgeon), I hope to build my own private practice and medical business. I want to be a part of Alpha Kappa Psi to build connections, network with other ambitious students, find mentors, learn how to build up a professional reputation, and most importantly, be an active member of a new team.","As a pre-med student, I can add to the diverse range of majors and professions within members throughout Alpha Kappa Psi. By being a part of this fraternity, I hope to work with and invite other pre-med students who are also interested creating their own medical practice or students looking to create their own start-ups. I am well-versed in collaboration and team efforts, so I will actively work alongside members to create an exciting, professional, and fun environment.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/cf93a46f9f405ecbdd3e8baf5a055f8c6996ea5e616e7183b6d7d861f4810a2c/Screen_Shot_2023_10_03_at_9.16.39_PM.png,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/64e3ddb65068e34c1eab609ad86c56fceece72cf0c88d6f46940962a1b9e52a2/ALLY_S_2023_RESUME.pdf,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/bec4782a25db33649156ddc0161a6a6898eb03e72523db223bfffd3e5b4e8aca/Alpha_Kappa_Psi_cover_letter_.pdf

I am seeking membership in Alpha Kappa Psi in order to gain professional and personal development while also making meaningful friendships.  I'm looking for a diverse group of individuals who are just as motivated as I am and will push me to become a better version of myself, and was attracted by the multitude of backgrounds and majors in the omicron omega chapter.","I believe that my diverse background, teamwork skills, and community service focus make me a great potential addition to Alpha Kappa Psi.  As an out of state student, I believe that I'll contribute a unique perspective to Alpha Kappa Psi.  Additionally, I can contribute teamwork skills that I have honed during part-time jobs in high school, as the competition captain of my DECA team, and as a founding member of my high school's business club.  Finally, I believe I can contribute a community service mindset, that matches with one of Alpha Kappa Psi's core principles.

Anirudh,Lahiri,,He/Him/His,anirudhlahiri@ucsb.edu,14087484750,"Manzanita Hall, Miranda House Room 1403",,2nd Year,2026,Mechanical Engineering & Biochemistry w/ TMP,"To preface, I am currently majoring in mechanical engineering and biochemistry; however, I really thought I was going to pursue finance for a significant portion of my life. A brief intro to finance in 5th grade eventually led to me day trading options over 10th and 11th grade in high school; however, it honestly became incredibly stressful. I think when one places themselves in stressful environments, they need both a deep-set passion in what they are doing and people surrounding them who share that drive. I believe I possessed passion for finance and econ, but had not developed enough of a support system to make it a sustainable practice–interestingly enough, this was really the point where I started realizing I wanted to pursue a career in STEM.

I primarily credit my transition and current pursuit of STEM solely on the amazing professors and incredibly insightful people I met within the field. It demonstrated to me how meaningful professors and fellow students can have a massive bearing on what you pursue which ended up being STEM. I am also very glad I was not intrinsically gifted in any STEM areas–I actually performed so poorly in my freshman year math class that I was unable to matriculate to the next level (bottom 2% of my grade). During networking, it was also very comforting to hear people talk so readily about obstacles they encountered along their journey of professional development as well as the ways in which they ultimately succeeded.

 My hanging on through the process was why it was incredibly meaningful when I finally started pursuing STEM–it was in spite of intrinsic aptitudes rather than focus on intrinsic talents. I feel the concept of persisting through failure has similar grounding to my desire to join AKPsi. When I applied last year, it was primarily driven by a general desire to get involved in some type of business organizations– applying this cycle was because I was looking for the specific values of AKPsi and was very deliberate in my thoughts about what I want out of my experience. AKPsi’s culture of collaboration and genuine interest in one another are the elements which are the most alluring to me.

Further on the topic of my personal allures to AKPsi, I really appreciate the manner people view and approach business ventures within it. I view business as a rather multidisciplinary subject and the fact that all majors are welcomed tells me that AKPsi shares that perspective. Through my discussions with actives at rush, I found that there were so many different niches that people were involved in and it has really been only a year of college so it is nice to know that if I move out of the particular niche I am currently in, want to revive an old one, or even decide to explore a totally differentiated area, AKPsi can serve as the optimal environment to achieve all of that.","I spent a large portion of my life struggling to hone in on what I wanted to pursue primarily because I viewed my future in terms of careers rather than passions I wanted to pursue–I focused a lot more on the ‘what’ instead of the ‘why’. Around the same time that I was lucky enough to find inspirational mentors and peers, I also started reading personal development books and watching a lot of motivational speakers. Books and people more experienced in a lot of fields really serve as a cheat code to growth–it lets me accumulate decades of advice and experience in a few hours. The perspective that I started to develop from the various successful speakers and authors serves as my most powerful asset and best contributing factor to AKPsi.

	Shifting to thinking more about the ‘why,’ I knew I wanted to pursue a profession which would help the most people possible and I thought doctor but I eventually realized that becoming a doctor wasn’t the only avenue towards helping people–I saw how a well developed piece of tech has the potential to change billions and more importantly how there are always multiple avenues to achieve a goal. I did not have to follow traditional routes and pathways and it was that adaptable nature of my thinking which led me to realize tech’s incredibly profound impact and something I hope to contribute to AKPsi if afforded the opportunity. However, back within the vein of tech’s impact, I also know the unlimited capacity of technology can only be realized with an equal emphasis in business because the manner through which you communicate, market and execute ideas holds equal if not more importance than the quality of the ideas themselves.

Coming into UCSB, I knew I wanted to pursue business so I resolved to do so through extracurricular work. I have been involved with Gaucho Creative since last winter, currently serving as a strategy consultant and recruitment director. I believe freedom and creativity of thinking within tasks serves as my best assets in contributing to business/consulting type work. To prove the viability of one of PHS’s virtual programs, I took IP address data from qualtrics and wrote a program to estimate the average costs involved accounting for average gas prices and opportunity costs of time. My ability to use creative lines of thinking and problem solving to develop unique solutions allows me to most effectively use even heavily limited resources/info to the fullest extent.

Despite the surfacely diverse range of experiences and spaces I have worked within, they all relied on an emphasis in creative thinking. I really think that is the brilliance in marketing–there is no cap to how clever and creative companies can be. Whether that be McDonald’s planting poppy flowers in the shape of their logo on the highway because it is an endangered flower (and illegal to remove) to Volvo winning in the Super Bowl ad realm without even running an ad (they had 1/15th the budget of most car companies but created a challenge where you can win a free car any time another car commercial was running during the superbowl, resulting in a 70% increased in sales the following month and numerous trending hashtags). The positioning these brands take and the strategies they developed are just something which fascinates me–something I do my best to emulate in as many (relevant) situations as possible.

I have been blessed enough to have a lot of success in my life. I co-founded an early dementia detection company backed by an MIT program, made it to national semifinals of KPMG ideation challenge, and served as president of the BMES. I also had a lot of fun along the way working on designing electric motorcycles, grinding out CorePower Yoga, and always ending days at the beach. I failed a lot too. I nearly got an F in studio art, had so many missteps within Gaucho Creative, BMES, and really everything I’ve done. Yet, all I have done these past few years has gone to inform what I believe is my greatest asset–my perspective. My exploration into both highly technical stem fields and entrepreneurial inclined endeavors as well as comfortability with failure enables a powerful combination. It is my understanding and being in all kinds of different extremes which gives me the best ability to contribute and take advantage of all the diverse positions, varied niches, and limitless opportunities AKPsi offers.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/e4ed991890548a43f9c4c649654f4713d371b9c9ff829082a5ec32ffd003a482/Ani_Lahiri_Headshot__1_.png,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/a31e9f76d76fd7f38c64c079ea9bea860ce9f512894257e26c91d110f021e27b/Final_Resume___Ani_Lahiri__Sept_12th_2023_.pdf,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/4ba9b0ea5084934ac83cdfe65723fc778e62d5b797c61c9f2eed4fba4842b3d5/Alpha_Kappa_Psi_Cover_Letter_F2023_Recruitment_Cycle.pdf

Being from Portland, OR; I've struggled to find the close intimate friendships I deeply value that align with discipline, ambition, and passion. I'm friends with a few members and I've heard amazing things regarding the ambitious and close attitude of members. I seriously would be so grateful to be granted the opportunity to be in the frat and believe I would be an amazing addition.","I've always been placed in leadership positions whether it be Speech and Debate or DECA in HS or working in managerial positions in the food service industry.

I also am a first-generation college student who comes from two parents who have struggled with substance addiction and intense mental illness. I have developed a strong emotional and logical judgment through the years of directing myself alone. Such judgment has led me to conventional and unconventional successes, some of which include bringing myself to a 4.0 standing in HS when I was originally suffering from truancy charges in middle school due to absent structure in my life. It’s one thing to be conventionally successful through the guidance of hopeful parents, and it’s another thing to do it on your own through experimentation and learning of what works and doesn’t work for you; it requires a strong development of identity and values that I believe a lot of people my age don’t possess due to having more conventionally privileged lifestyles.

Austin,Son,,He/Him/His,ason@ucsb.edu,7147221925,765 Embarcadero Del Norte,,2nd Year,2026,Economics and Statistics and Data Science,"I seek membership in Alpha Kappa Psi because I appreciate how tight-knit this fraternity is and how they motivate each other to succeed in life. Growing up, I have always been around people who never really prioritized education and their future career aspirations. As a result, I would always have to find it within myself to keep working hard and not lose sight of my goals in life.  Now that I am at UC Santa Barbara, I want to find a group of friends who will have a friendly competition in life where we motivate each other to be the best we can academically and socially. When I attended these rush events, I felt this exact vibe when talking to all the actives of this fraternity.

In addition, I want to develop professionally, which is a key part of why I was interested in seeking membership in Alpha Kappa Psi. While I am a social individual who knows how to carry a conversation and keep it lively, I find myself having difficulty talking to professionals in a formal manner. In addition, interviews have always been a very difficult task that I dread when applying for jobs and internships. I want to be able to have the edge when having to deal with a professional setting and I believe that this fraternity will provide the events, resources, and people to enhance my professional skills. Also, building my resume is something that I want to be able to do. From many of the actives from rush events, I heard that their interview skills and their resume became a lot better as they joined Alpha Kappa Psi, and I would love to improve these parts of my professional portfolio as well.

Lastly, leadership is a skill that I always wanted to obtain. Before I came to college, I never really had the leadership skills that a lot of people developed through being in clubs, student leadership groups, etc. So, I wanted to be able to join a fraternity and hold a position where I could exhibit my leadership skills. I know that Alpha Kappa Psi has many leadership opportunities, and this is something that I would be very interested in.","I believe that I can contribute a lot to Alpha Kappa Psi. The first thing I would be able to contribute is a positive attitude and solidarity. This is a crucial aspect of being in a fraternity, especially when there are a lot of members in one. It is inevitable that there will be people who may not be the closest friends with another person in the fraternity, but I believe that I have a rare skill that brings people together and fosters unity. I have done this several times in my friend groups and this is an ability that is extremely underrated.

In addition, if I were to join Alpha Kappa Psi, I would be very strong in community service and philanthropy. In high school, I was always involved in many volunteering opportunities and philanthropic events. I played high school basketball from my freshman year to my senior year, so I would always have to raise money to support our basketball season. As a result, I have always been around philanthropic opportunities, and I feel like I would excel in this aspect of Alpha Kappa Psi. In addition, I volunteered for many organizations such as the Red Cross, Meals on Wheels, Big Brothers Big Sisters, etc. As a result, I have seen how crucial community service is for our community.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/68780eb35623dcf2632459af73ed75cbec9911144013e239df193cdc8adfff7e/IMG_4303.JPG,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/d686d15474ed77341c9da732d1fe334ebe743942208ac93f73069290554f5e45/Austin_s_Resume.pdf,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/7ef937101e8936da2046b6f068e298eed85010bf502aa66820b15d4d36878bb7/Cover_Letter_for_Alpha_Kappa_Psi.pdf

Isabella,Solis,,She/Her/Hers,isabellasolis@ucsb.edu,5129405613,956 Camino Corto Unit B,,3rd Year,Spring 2025,Financial Mathematics and Statistics,"I became intrigued by Alpha Kappa Psi with the notion of finding a group of individuals who were working together to achieve similar goals. As someone who isn’t very familiar with the business industry and engages in extracurriculars that commonly attract more artistic majors, I was hoping that Alpha Kappa Psi could be a place for me to connect on a professional and personal level like I hadn’t before. While this reasoning still rings true, my desire to join Alpha Kappa Psi has only grown after speaking to the members. I have seen firsthand how tight-knit the group is, and been given the opportunity to hear about the goals various members have achieved that are very similar to mine. I am seeking membership because I believe that I can contribute new ideas and perspectives, and continue to cultivate the already existing groundwork of strong-work ethic and positive reputation that Alpha Kappa Psi has built. Even though I have only spent a small amount of time seeing who Alpha Kappa Psi is I already feel confident that it could be an incredibly special guide throughout the rest of my college experience.","On paper, I can bring even more diversity of culture to Alpha Kappa Psi. As a woman of color I think that joining spaces and ensuring that my identity is represented is incredibly important, and I know that Alpha Kappa Psi would offer a great hand in helping me. I have many passions that I believe make me an incredibly well-rounded candidate. My background of music has shaped me into a better writer and more confident individual, and my history of competitive dance has taught me important lessons about teamwork and strong work ethic. I hope to show others how I integrate my various passions into each other to create the person that I am, both to inspire and aid in others hoping to do the same. I am involved in other clubs on campus such as the UCSB dance team and a student-led musical theater club.

Kevin,Deng,,He/Him/His,kevindeng@ucsb.edu,4086886091,555 Storke Rd,Apt 1303,3rd Year,Spring 2025,Computer Science,"Out of everything Alpha Kappa Psi takes pride in, what stands out to me the most is professionalism and brotherhood. This past week, I was able to engage in rich conversations with students from different majors pursuing a wide array of career paths from biotechnology to teaching. I learned a lot about each active’s career journey and how Alpha Kappa Psi helped shape their professional interests and skill sets in order to achieve success. In this aspect, I particularly enjoyed the alumni panel yesterday as it showcased the many places the fraternity has brought them career-wise. I want to have the opportunity to experience professional growth within the fraternity and eventually add to the fraternity’s name. Already, I have already received valuable feedback on my cover letter, something I have never done, and I have already gained invaluable knowledge regarding professionalism and industry at rush, and I look forward to developing myself further within the fraternity.

Talking with actives brought out the strength of brotherhood present in the fraternity, and it is something I see myself being a part of, having each other’s backs during rough times and pushing each other to become the best versions of ourselves we can be. Whether it be through a social or professional lens, I see myself being a part of a community that emphasizes living a well-rounded life, chasing their dream careers while still living in the moment and enjoying the presence of close friends all the time. Another valuable part of Alpha Kappa Psi that I treasure lies in the diverse active body, and being a part of that community would open my eyes to new insights, opportunities, and cultures, helping me break out of the computer science shell and to learn something new in every conversation. This would broaden my lens of how I live and view the world. I would be grateful for membership consideration at the Omicron Omega Chapter.","Having moved to different states over 5 times in my life, I oftentimes struggle to find community in new places I live in. Recently, I moved to Seattle and it was then that I realized the importance of a strong community I feel a part of, and that is something I am searching for in Alpha Kappa Psi and is something I am hoping to promote and contribute to for current and future students.

Building and maintaining a positive, uplifting, and vibrant community at Alpha Kappa Psi as well as making an impact within the fraternity is something I am looking forward to achieving. Recently, I joined UCSB’s Taiwanese American Student Association as a general staff member, hoping to help plan new events for members to promote TASA’s uplifting community. Before the start of school, I helped organize a club-wide sunset hike which was a huge success with 34 members in attendance, and received feedback that members felt a strong sense of community and that members met new people during the event. By becoming a member of Alpha Kappa Psi, I want to instill the same sense of community and to strengthen the brotherhood. Whether it is within the bounds of my pledge class or the general active body, I will strive to foster the brotherhood by taking on leadership positions that will add to the fraternity’s name.

Giving back to the community is something I also take pride in, and as an outlet for philanthropic endeavors, Alpha Kappa Psi would give me the opportunity to do so. At UCSB, I partook in volunteering at Isla Vista Elementary tutoring students in areas of STEM and trying to inspire STEM interests within them. I am excited to use Alpha Kappa Psi’s resources and network to pursue philanthropy on a greater scale to raise money and give back to the community. I consider myself to be a quick learner, and I hope to put that to use when learning about areas that are new to me - marketing, design, etc. - but are necessary to promote philanthropy and raise money. Hence, not only would I add impact to one of Alpha Kappa Psi’s core pillars, I would also be developing myself professionally outside the scope of my major, something I really look forward to.

Another way I see myself contributing to the fraternity is bringing my past industry experiences with me. My work history consists of working as a barista at Ume Tea to a student assistant at UCSB’s Materials Research Lab to a Software Engineer Intern at Leidos. I possess great insights for people looking for career advice and would be more than willing to help guide members (especially those who may be younger than me) in achieving success in the workforce. For members in Computer Science specifically, as I have taken most of UCSB’s upper-division Computer Science courses, I can be of great use for course recommendations, cautions, and guidance to help Computer Science majors be successful in the classroom.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/451cedd10cc52fa76fbf4a7110b4fe712157d2ed5d7968f702eb3a905d071c47/IMG_2939.jpg,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/7e1a865873758bdc3013a2bb77dfbd51b1796551bc73f73b478ae8fded8e47e4/Kevin_Resume.pdf,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/3cdd8c86e3e7b215d2d8f39679202869917be8c5f638d7070333f08228629a3b/Kevin_Cover_Letter.pdf

Kyra,Maeda,,She/Her/Hers,kyramaeda@ucsb.edu,9255231631,6626 Picasso Rd.,Unit 20,2nd Year,Spring 2026,Financial Mathematics and Statistics,"I am interested in gaining membership to Alpha Kappa Psi because I am impressed with the Omicron Omega chapter’s commitment to fulfilling the five pillars, especially the brotherhood pillar. While AKPsi brings together like-minded individuals, I value the differences that each member contributes to the fraternity. The chance to be part of a pledge class where every individual enters with diverse personal and professional skill sets would be an invaluable opportunity for me. I have always thrived in environments where I can collaborate with peers to bounce ideas off of each other and learn how other people think. Because of this, I believe that the collaborative community of AKPSI would help me to become more comfortable working in the professional world. I recently became a marketing intern for a small software company in Goleta called Event Staff App. As a remote position, the founder emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility as it can be hard to constantly collaborate online given that most interns are full-time students. Since my internship will help me to gain experience working in an individual setting, I would love to learn from AKPsi how to better work in a team setting.","I am a dedicated team player who understands that every success and failure is a learning experience. I believe that my optimism and ability to maintain composure in high pressure situations would help me to contribute to AKPsi. Last year I joined the club Ultimate Frisbee team at UCSB without ever having played before. In my first tournament of the season, I was put onto the field and my coaches quickly ran through a play using terms that I had not heard before. I was scared to ask a question because we were in a rush for time, so I declined to speak up. I remember feeling ashamed of myself because I had messed up in the game by not defending a player when I should have been because I misunderstood my coach’s directions. Afterward, I talked to my captains and coaches and asked them what I could have done better to improve for next time. I had to quickly push past feelings of self-doubt and stay focused because my team needed me and ended up scoring a goal later that game. If I were to become a member of AKPSi, I would use what I learned from my time on the ultimate frisbee team to stay calm in unfamiliar professional settings. I would also like to be a member that people know that they can count on for anything.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/0c6f8b9472995d860337f2ac007a6772bc813b9fbe0fcfecf026ba7bf4744340/IMG_5438.jpeg,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/bcf3d7be22f7450e3bf68ff3b3da5725773958e2993e2131ebb9d9078fb87c6e/AKPsi_Resume.pdf,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/53cfdd54dbc15f107961947cea6b94ff22747dd2ad1b4018a37a81eb82829973/AKPsi_CoverLetter.pdf

I am also in the process of changing my major from biopsychology to financial math and stats because I realized the pre-med path was not right for me. Business has always interested me, but I have never taken the chance to explore everything it has to offer. I believe Alpha Kappa Psi can help me figure out what I really want to do, career wise. I also want to join Alpha Kappa Psi to grow and develop professionally because there are so many aspects that go into finding the right job and how to obtain it, so I'd love to learn more about professionalism and different career paths in the business world. Overall, my main goal is to branch out and meet more people that I can make lasting connections with socially and professionally.","As a member of Alpha Kappa Psi, I can bring the skills and knowledge that I've gained from working in a hospital. As a nurse technician, I acquired hands-on experience and knowledge working in a fast paced environment. I also interacted with many people from various backgrounds and ages. From this, I've learned how to effectively communicate and cooperate with different patients, doctors, and nurses. These interpersonal skills will be carried over into Alpha Kappa Psi. I also prioritize commitment, dedication, and time management after working 12-hour shifts and 30+ hours per week at the hospital. This strong work ethic and high commitment will be exhibited in Alpha Kappa Psi, as I will fully commit my time and energy into the fraternity.

Additionally, I will contribute my strong organizational and leadership skills that I've learned from being a team captain for multiple sports teams. I have past experience organizing events such as dinners, social outings, and holiday parties. In Alpha Kappa Psi, I would bring new ideas to help organize fundraisers, philanthropy events, and socials. I find working with others to help those in need is extremely rewarding, and I have some experience volunteering in local homeless shelters. As a brother, I would heavily involve myself in community service because I enjoy helping others and volunteering reinforces a sense of purpose for something more important than myself.

Lastly, I would be an excellent addition to Alpha Kappa Psi because I value brotherhood and will uplift others. I am always searching for genuine connections with people and finding those who I really click with. Having a community that will always support me and help me grow is a huge priority, so as a member in Alpha Kappa Psi, I will give back the same energy and support to the other members.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/eae337255c77f2de5b2186939359f70d86592e97696b532497930d349d63f3ca/IMG_8364.jpeg,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/67149dc2addac0596404c05dbe8868b01ae5ed9738a4f32221de8523d69b694f/LilyHirshResume___.pdf,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/24eda48f3a95a2879429d8017fd490d18fc218f8960275688b3f60a0d0abb031/AK_Psi_cover_letter.pdf

Throughout Rush, I have been impressed by how much the brothers of Alpha Kappa Psi have adhered to these values, as well as the kindness, willingness and interest in helping others and professionalism that they have shown. Whilst I have spent just 4 hours networking and meeting the active members within the fraternity, I feel that I have gained a good understanding of the organization and its core values, which I feel align directly with my own. I therefore feel that Alpha Kappa Psi would be a good cultural fit for me, enabling me to expand my professional acumen whilst making lifelong connections in the process.","Through my extensive experiences in finance, I feel that I have gained a wide variety of professional skills that would be directly applicable to my membership of Alpha Kappa Psi. I maintain high standards of professionalism, integrity and a commitment to excellence. I know that I am someone who can be trusted to always deliver, and I would throw myself into any responsibilities with a view to create the best result possible.

With an expansive knowledge of finance recruitment processes in both the USA and Europe, as well as my status as a 3rd year student, I feel that I would be well equipped to assist my fellow brothers in their preparation for these careers, as well as give insight into the financial services industry and the reputation of different firms within it.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/ee9d0a3270a85aa4890c788c255455e0ca706a565b7e8ddb4dffd2202d29e182/Headshot1.jpg,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/fbf1c1c1915170d54a3badbe97cf69c395630f024f007f8903bc95a47f9c0743/LK.CV.04.10.23.UCSB.AKP.pdf,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/fd9fd3c61311a3bfb2d62785f7e6c216d6cd64971dea381d5a0825f05bb3f493/AKP_CL.pdf
Mark,Foley,,He/Him/His,markfoley@ucsb.edu,8312503924,807 Embarcadero del Norte,,2nd Year,Spring 2026,Economics,"I find that Alpha Kappa Psi would offer me the proper social and professional network that no other organization on campus would be able to give me. I never was interested in regular social Greek life, for example, as I felt that the culture wasn't cohesive with me personally, but felt that a professional organization would give me the social grouping without any of the negative aspects. Similarly, I feel that, at this point in my college experience, I need to seek out professional opportunities, which after talking to members of Alpha Kappa Psi, seem to lie in the group. Without understatement, I felt myself around friends during the networking portion of the info night, with me finding all members to be agreeable and like-minded, which I feel could only compliment my development.","Over the past couple of years, I’ve accumulated a series of experiences and accolades that I view as all contributing to my personal development, whether it be in the interpersonal realm, the professional environment, and my character as a person. Although from my high school years, I was extensively involved in my school's Model UN team, acting firstly as the clubs treasurer and later president. As mentioned, these experiences assisted my development both personally and professionally, with both positions requiring me to engage interpersonally with students, faculty, and other outside actors, while also developing my leadership and collaborative abilities. Such skills would all contribute to my ability to connect with and uplift others within Alpha Kappa Psi.

Such experiences didn’t end there however, as I found unique professional niches in my college years. For example, I joined the UCSB Commercial Real Estate Association, a professional group catered to both teaching the fundamentals of this industry, but as well expand ones breadth of knowledge when it comes to networking, professional development, and even teaching on-the-job material, such as financial modeling of cash flows, debt statements, et cetera. Over the course of my freshman year, I was able to become an executive officer, inwhich I took a leadership role in the club. In this role, I found myself stepping far from my comfort zone, being thrust into unique responsibilities that I found to be, in retrospect, contributional to myself. Take for example, my experience tabling, marketing the organization, or instructing others on course content. In this role, I was able to discover my leadership and interpersonal abilities, and understand both my strengths and weaknesses when dealing in these extensively social roles. For example, I now understand how best I can collaborate with others, such as discovering my weakness of feeling the need to take excessive responsibility in projects. Were I to be in Alpha Kappa Psi, I would be able to take my unique vulnerabilities, and discovery of my shortcomings, into the forefront in a productive manner, and be able to connect and work with my fellow brothers and sisters.
	Beyond this, I have been affirmed for much of my life of my ability to quickly gain the trust and grace of others, which is something that I hope to be able to apply in a larger group setting such as in Alpha Kappa Psi. In such an environment, I feel that I'd be able to connect with those around me, allowing me to be a collaborative and uplifting member in this group environment.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/0626cf9e204cda0c5445bd5733cc39c1db43ce72043d1a9e68e1124975c1faf6/1665635949124.jpg,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/a56786f52f6e98a12d75aaa8622a9fa555d8aa200e022ad5e24ce844706cdb5d/MarkFoleyResumeProfessional.pdf,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/1c7605b9944ff136140105d789870fce04d472e085a0e887e03f5f8a9d8a4357/AKPsiCoverLetter.pdf

Fulfillment and moral reward are critical foundations in my search for a profession; Serving people and communities and ultimately contributing to a positive progression for humankind. It wasn’t until I learned about Alpha Kappa Psi that I realized there exists a place and community where my career-oriented and personal passions intersected so fluidly. The Omicron Omega chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi encourages me to explore my approaches to personal and professional development with a shared drive to improve the quality of life for our communities. My current approach to leadership is centered on flexibility–pursuing personal ambitions while motivating and supporting peers in their endeavors, especially to build a collaborative environment fueled by mutual inspiration. Although I feel extremely aligned with Alpha Kappa Psi’s team culture, I also resonate deeply with how unique and distinct each member truly is. It’s fascinating to meet people with different opinions, backgrounds, and goals despite being in a community where it’s easy to conform to one mindset. I believe that within the Omicron Omega chapter, my drive to serve people and communities will be suitably curated (and encouraged) towards Alpha Kappa Psi’s goals, and my proactivity to optimize and perfect my approaches to social and professional contexts will be reciprocated by the community.

On a personal note, I also am hoping Alpha Kappa Psi will become a channel for criticism. I believe criticism and feedback (sometimes aggressive, oftentimes brutally honest) are crucial for improvement, and Alpha Kappa Psi is the one community that can provide this to an honest and developmental level. I am truly drawn to Alpha Kappa Psi because of the community's innate drive to push each other to improve and grow to meet greater expectations.","My core beliefs in community are inclusivity, progression, and mutual mentorship. These are the pillars to my approach in any environment, and I am confident that my community-building skills can be curated to Alpha Kappa Psi’s base mission and intricate goals. My experiences working in diverse environments have instilled in me a deep appreciation for diversity and inclusion, alongside a commitment to tending to processes with delicate attention to detail while building towards a greater vision. I am always ready to push myself and my peers to improve and progress by inspiring one another and motivating all to be proactive and to contribute. My expansive curiosity fuels me to learn more about any and every topic, and how to support and push other's ambitions atop my own.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/6f85c2f7bae5d69558e4a569bb9aa10a18ffab2931e2f78e0c5e2001522512a3/headshot.jpg,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/025a91efc6433ffdcff3e958eb202f362da7e8a293600161b239129d204b7ee3/Mia_Sha_Resume_for_Alpha_Kappa_Psi_Omicron_Omega_Chapter.pdf,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/5e7d6395669e205c41cf3d306dcd595a4030b375a64bd5ed4699fd49320f406f/Mia_Sha_Cover_Letter_for_Alpha_Kappa_Psi_Omicron_Omega_Chapter.pdf

Pranav,Hegde,,He/Him/His,pranavhegde@ucsb.edu,9253640034,Anacapa Hall,,1st Year,Spring 2027,Financial Mathematics and Statistics,"As I start my new chapter here at UCSB, I wish to find a community where I can connect with people professionally and also build personal relationships that last a lifetime long. Alpha Kappa Psi provides a base in which I can satisfy both of these wants.

Coming from a relatively competitive high school in the Bay Area, my initial experiences and the words of my older friends suggested that Santa Barbara would have a more laid-back atmosphere. I instantly appreciated this aspect of my new environment. Growing up in such a rigorous community taught me to do well in competition, but not necessarily to like such a cutthroat nature. In fact, I always preferred mutual benefit to a community where each member was pitted against each other. However, I wanted to make sure that I would not feel too relaxed and lose my ambition in college as well. Thus, AKPsi caught my attention when I saw the chance to not only make friends, but also professional partners who can mentor me and assist in developing me to the best form of myself. I believe that this society will keep me driven and point me in the direction during my time in UCSB.

I also appreciated that AKPsi’s society is not limited to a single major. As a financial math and statistics major, this is especially useful to me, as I can learn from members of all the different related majors as I figure out which aspect of finance, math, or statistics I want to emphasize later on.

The society of AKPsi is versatile, which gives me a chance to make professional connections with a vast network of people in different fields, but also make friends with diverse perspectives that I can learn from.","I see myself bringing a sense of reliability and helpfulness with my role in AKPsi, as I want all of my fellow members to succeed and have high ambitions.

As the founder of the drumline club in my high school, I learned a lot about how to work in a group and effectively communicate so that all of us could perform in unison and work on improving our musicality. I did this by catering towards individuals and their learning habits in order to best suit them, and placing them with like-minded peers. These communication and team-building skills are a way in which I can add value to the AKPsi community, by building on the cooperative networking environment and organizing groups to maximize productivity.

During my last three years as the Officer of Public Outreach for the local San Ramon Valley Science Olympiad, I gained a sense of professionalism through communicating with staff members of my school district, and scientists in relevant fields. I hope to bring this experience into networking in order to promote strong introductions with companies such as consulting firms. I also learned how to market myself, and be confident when reaching out to professionals, which AKPsi can utilize for any outreach required with firms, staff members, and even students.

Besides making friends and building a network, I see myself contributing by being an open-minded, active member of this society. Similarly to how I am currently seeking the mentorship aspects of AKPsi, I hope to be able to serve as a mentor and give back to the community in my own form later on.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/8c9a5f4935fcffad4dcc84f42ef539a5cb23cda83a085512307c92755a10d71d/IMG_3796D.jpg,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/66dfd92ea93a91bfa450cb748ebc77332a07a9b39c0f4f631445c247bd1f1eb7/Pranav_Hegde_Resume_FINAL_AKPsi.docx,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/cff736de04d7532d559224b951419299c8add6474255b0a4ef8b9096873470a7/Cover_Letter_final.pdf

Being around like-minded individuals who share these values is highly motivating, as I see Alpha Kappa Psi as a platform where I am able to grow academically and socially while also contributing to a supportive community of peers.

Besides the balance between academics and social life, my desire to join Alpha Kappa Psi is also driven by the opportunity of professional development.

Saanvi,Pabbichetty,,She/Her/Hers,spabbichetty@ucsb.edu,408-913-3112,"UCEN Rd, San Miguel Hall, East Tower","Floor 6, RM 6211",1st Year,2027,Data Science and Statistics (potential double major/minor in Economics),"I am eager to join Alpha Kappa Psi, driven by my desire to connect with a community of like-minded individuals. During the Informational Night, I had the opportunity to engage with the brothers and immediately sensed the strong bond within AKPSI. As one brother aptly described it, it's the place where one finds the people they’d invite to their wedding. I love the fraternity’s inclusive atmosphere, and how it brings together students from diverse backgrounds, all united by their ambitious mindset and grand future aspirations.  I feel that at AKPSI, no matter what your interests are, you will receive complete support and guidance from your fellow members. Currently pursuing a major in data science and statistics, I am considering a double major in economics. AKPSI presents an ideal platform for me to explore the fascinating intersection of technology and finance, helping me determine my ideal career path. From engaging workshops and networking opportunities to collaborative projects I can work on, I envision gaining invaluable professional development skills and tailored advice on potential career pathways. This enhanced skill set would undoubtedly bolster my candidacy for internships and future job opportunities. I recognize the importance of building meaningful relationships in both personal and professional contexts, and at AKPSI, I would get the chance to foster both these connections. Belonging to this exceptional, driven, and closely-knit community would be an honor, and I genuinely hope to receive the opportunity to contribute to its brilliance.","I believe my contributions to Alpha Kappa Psi would be valuable and aligned with the fraternity’s core values and goals. As a leader, I possess strong motivational and guidance skills, which were honed through my involvement with the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) Club and Key Club at my high school. At Prospect High, I discovered that many girls were interested in coding but hesitated to explore it further. As beginners in such a male bastion, they felt that they would be marginalized. To dispel that demoralizing experience, I started SWE, which facilitated a no-pressure, collaborative learning environment. I instructed over 75 girls in coding languages such as Python and Java, introduced them to various applications of technology, and guided them through hands-on projects like constructing mini-robots. I also orchestrated events featuring guest speakers to further motivate them to venture into the tech domain. In my role as president of Key Club, I significantly improved member retention and overall club membership by strategically organizing service events and optimized club operations. I also ensured that the club would demonstrate an uninterrupted commitment to the community during the challenging pandemic period by devising innovative service projects. Through these past experiences, I learned valuable organization and event planning skills, both of which would enable me to contribute effectively to planning and executing events for Alpha Kappa Psi. In addition to my organizational and leadership skills, I thrive in a collaborative environment, and strive to foster a sense of community amongst diverse groups of individuals. My experiences in my four years on the Girls Varsity Tennis team and my senior year job as Brand Representative at Abercrombie have allowed me to interact with people from various age groups and backgrounds; these experiences have also taught me how to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcomed and valued. Overall, my commitment to excellence, personal ambition, and hard-working nature are foundational aspects of my character. I am excited about the opportunity to join the Alpha Kappa Psi and dedicate my skills and passion to further its mission and promote a thriving sense of unity.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/40e84429f64fcf45e4be9da80a07b32e87affed362260af918f3a278a551f4f3/saanvi_pabbichetty_picture.pdf,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/c9a7a21c3297817dee10fd506a7538b30f1d39069f322613fc9b6e3268b04246/AKPSI_Resume___Saaanvi_Pabbichetty.pdf,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/ceea38d3ab4b07fe57533b6ad90a3e88da2fe08ed8cb302538ec9225787e23a6/AKPSI_Cover_Letter.pdf

Upon my admittance into UC Santa Barbara, I sought the advice of alumni from my school who attended UCSB and the #1 piece of advice I received was to join AKPsi as I was told from multiple members that it was the best decision they made in their freshman year of college. I immediately went into researching the fraternity, interacting with all the tabling booths across campus including the ones at the clubs fair and the UEA business fair. The more I learned about the fraternity and their mission, the more I felt like this was the right fit for me. Being part of a brotherhood of smart and ambitious people that are bonded not only through college but through life, as seen by the extensive alumni network, was something I knew I couldn’t miss being part of. The amount of business connections and opportunities for growth through networking and professional development events in AKPsi was also something that made me positive this was the right path for my future. I have always been keen on making my impact in the business world but I see that as part of a large community of ambitious individuals who also share that goal, I can put the ideals  and goals of the fraternity above my own to grow together as part of the brotherhood.","My versatility of skills as a person and diverse background in the business world makes me an asset to AKPsi. I have explored many fields of business, through doing research and investing in NFTs and cryptocurrency, to assisting in the sale of real estate, I have always been someone who seeks knowledge and loves to network with people. My experience in debate has given me the confidence to speak freely and advocate for myself and others.

Being able to present myself in a professional manner and strike up meaningful conversations is crucial to my growth because the financial service industry involves presenting findings and concepts to not only data experts but also to non-technical audiences. In order to discuss business models or persuade the audience to support my argument, I should be able to network in the most effective and professional way possible and I believe I will gain such experience through my involvement with Alpha Kappa Psi. Most importantly, the brothers I have met during rush events displayed a “work hard, play hard” mindset, a culture that I wish to continue practicing throughout the rest of my college career. Work-life balance in today’s working age remains a significant concern, but joining Alpha Kappa Psi will push me towards setting boundaries for myself and holding me accountable for my academic and social outcomes. Beyond this tight-knit community, I would like to pursue an interest related to data science and NLP and I strongly believe joining Alpha Kappa Psi would help me expand my academic potential while also providing me with a group of brothers that I can always look towards.","After holding multiple leadership positions through high school, I believe I am a valuable addition to Alpha Kappa Psi because I strive to put myself in uncomfortable situations and respond with composure in times of pressure. Further, my work ethic and positive attitude help me adapt to sudden changes and embrace challenges with open arms. Whether it means addressing a large group of students during a presentation or delegating specific tasks to teammates before a deadline, I maintain professionalism and integrity in every interaction. As a cooperative partner, I aspire to create an inclusive environment around me and foster a positive team dynamic through sharing goals and personal enthusiasm. On an individual level, I am persistent in practicing and maintaining a group’s values and wish to play an impactful role in spreading Alpha Kappa Psi’s core values, such as brotherhood and honest service, through our networking and philanthropy events. Lastly, my openness toward new ideas, people, and skills will allow me to continue promoting creativity with my future Alpha Kappa Psi brothers.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/68158bbe0a842a2c04f7353e4ac5ad865208cbb447b01d836fd188c827551468/ID_removebg_preview__1_.png,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/8c495c7ece11d7a85ab8b2b0fba683add824cb7e8cbce17de46627bbc5081ef8/Satvik_Talchuru___Resume.pdf,https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/ac92d6c3143302cfedf0a93f43ee832690c8fca88a3ec4d6efefd31a93830f3e/Cover_Letter_AKPsi___Satvik_Talchuru.pdf

I wanted to grow as an individual within the business etiquette, interviewing abilities, and public speaking parts of my future career. Additionally, I am super interested in the networking, my goal as a career is to go into VC and as UCSB isn't a target school, I think the networking within AKPsi would open that path. Finally, the type of student that joins AKPsi entices me. The opportunity to be surrounded by other driven individuals who have high aspirations is unique within the groups I've considered, and I feel as though being surrounded by like-minded individuals may help motivate me further.","As a member of AKPsi I feel as though I would bring a balanced mindset, in the way that I am both devoted to learning and teaching. With the opportunity to be part of a career focused group, comes the amount of pure knowledge and experience available to learn. At the same time, I want the chance to help others, by teaching about my experiences, eventually being seen as a mentor. Also, I bring a self-driven mind set on problem solving.

Through business school, I was surrounded by peers that inspired me, and that shared the same passions and goals for their future. Everyone filled their schedules with business clubs, business fraternities, and workshops. I got swept into the craze of packing my schedule full of resume-enhancing opportunities. At the end of the year, I was starting to understand what burnout was and needed to prioritize what organizations I wanted to be a part of. I had heard so much about Alpha Kappa Psi from my colleagues that I decided to rush the following year and prioritize this brotherhood.  Unfortunately, I left Indiana University to attend a CC to get my transfer requirements. As I am starting out my junior year at UCSB, I couldn't be more excited that I have the opportunity to seek membership at Alpha Kappa Psi.
Alpha Kappa Psi embodies all the components I loved from all the original business clubs I was a part of. AKSI would provide a safe space to develop my skills and improve my weaknesses with the support of the brothers. The club provides a fantastic network across the world, which would help me put my foot in the industry I end up choosing to pursue. Besides the professional experience gained from this club, I would find positive and nurturing friendships within the community. I hope to give back to AKSI what it can provide for me. I want to strengthen the community by always being there for my friends and peers, whether taking someone to the beach to uplift their mood or editing a resume at 3 a.m. before a big interview for someone else. I plan to fully take advantage of all the opportunities AKSI offers while building lasting friendships and contributing to the uplifting professional community.","I am a hardworking individual who has a love for learning. My resilient attitude allows me to be fully present for my peers, offering a helping hand whenever I can. I hope to join a community that is not only there for me, but also encourages my support for others. Whether a brother needs to be comforted or needs to practice a speech in front of someone a hundred times, I truly enjoy being able to be there for them. My resilience also pushes me to take on new roles, and I hope to gain a leadership position down the road within the organization. My goals would be to continue fostering an open-minded community and making sure each brother was getting the support they needed to reach their goals.
Besides support for my fellow peers, I hope to create a network for entrepreneurship and contribute my knowledge and connections to helping others reach their goals.

I know that whether I decide to pursue bioinformatics or pre-health, business knowledge and professional skills are invaluable in either field, and being part of AKPsi would allow me to develop my professional skills through hands-on experiences.

I find AKPsi's emphasis on community involvement particularly appealing, as I have organized events that incorporate community engagement, including initiatives aimed at introducing middle and high school students to essential professional skills for both their academic pursuits and future endeavors.

I have family on the east coast that attended NYU that are longtime alumni of AKPsi that heavily advocated that I join if my college offers it. Thankfully for me, UCSB has blessed me with the opportunity to connect with AKPsi and get the chance to apply to AKPsi.

On top of the professional development that AKPsi offers, I look forward to getting the chance to meet like-minded individuals and get to grow alongside my peers. As it is my first year in college, I want to be able to build connections with the members of AKPsi and get involved in building a lifelong community.

Not only that, but I’ve always struggled with large social groups and learning how to interact in that environment, and I feel that AKPsi would be a great building block for me to fix that issue and help me progress not only professionally, but personally as well. There are so many opportunities that I see AKPsi providing for their members, and I would love to be a part of that and eventually give back those opportunities to others.

I don’t want to live my life with any regrets, and I feel like if I pass on the opportunity to join AKPsi, I would definitely regret it. Everything that I’ve heard about AKPsi has been a good thing and I feel like the community fits me and the type of person that I am.

Cliché or not, there’s only one Taylor LeGodais on this planet, and that’s me. In the same sense, the only person that could contribute the same experiences, lessons, and skill sets to Alpha Kappa Psi would be me. I’m a character that can be professional with serious goals and passions, while also still being a human that you could go out with and rely on. I could offer different perspectives on political or economic topics. I could crack a joke at a time of misfortune that could brighten the mood. I could offer a bright, new imagination that AKPsi has never seen before.

In all honesty, the main thing that separates me from all other applicants is that I could contribute to AKPsi is myself, and all that comes with me. All my history and my previous experiences, all my current emotions and my present, and all my future and the opportunities it holds.
